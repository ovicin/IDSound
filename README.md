# IDSound - Participative music performance toolkit
## Abstract
In 2015 Sonar introduces for the first time the NFC cashless payment system for everything that was sold inside the festival. Each person that atended the festival had one of this tags. IDSound is a critical engineering project that exploits this system and is using the identification data that is stored on these tags to generate a unique sound id for each atendee of the festival. Together with a "smart" glove this system is used for a participative music performance.

## Sonar +D Barcelona MusicHackDay 2015

The project was developed during the Barcelona Music Hack Day 2015 hackaton that was hosted by Sonar +D. For this year the theme of the hackaton was wearebles so we decided to hack the weareble device that everybody in the festival had, the cashless payment system. 

We also made a performance glove with integrated sensors to be used by a performer as a sound controller.
